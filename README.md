**Lab 6 – Programming Arrays and Loops in Python**

**(90 points)**

**Part I: (40 points)**

For the last problem in Assignment 6, convert your algorithms into python code. Take a look at the python video that discusses this problem first:

**Part II:**

**P2. (10 points)**

Write a Python function called **string\_times** that takes two parameters: a string and a number, and prints output in the following format:

- string\_times(&#39;Hi&#39;, 2) → &#39;HiHi&#39;
- string\_times(&#39;Hi&#39;, 3) → &#39;HiHiHi&#39;

You **MUST** use a while loop in your solution.

**P3. (10 points)**

Write a Python program to find all numbers that are divisible by 7 and 5 between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

**P4. (10 points)**

Write a Python program that reads in 5 numeric values, stores them in an array, then prints them out in the reverse order that they were entered. Use this case to test your program:

- 10 27 23 12 81 81 12 23 27 10





**P5. (20 points)**

Write a Python program that keeps reading in names and ages from the user, until the user enters 0. Once the user enters 0, you should print out all the information that was entered by the user. Use this case to test your program:

- **Input:**
John 61
Marcel 17
Daisy 25
Samantha 52
Nelson 71
Deborah 46
0
================

**Output:**
John 61
Marcel 17
Daisy 25
Samantha 52
Nelson 71
Deborah 46

Use two arrays to hold the names and the ages. Once the user enters 0, stop reading in data, and start printing out all the data in the two arrays in the same order that they were entered.

**Lab Deliverables:**
For all problems, submit a screen shot of your code and your obtained output.
